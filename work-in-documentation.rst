Work in documentation
=====================

I'm interested in technical documentation, including its practice, theory, organisational
strategy and execution. I believe it should be a discipline based on rigorous foundations.

*Documentation* could be a user guide for a programming language or framework, or the operating
manuals for a product such an electric toothbrush, a camera or an airliner. A handbook for
conference organisers, or members of a team in a company would count too. I mostly work with
software product documentation.

What all of the above have in common is that they are **written materials that support a
practitioner in a domain of skilled practice**.

This definition places the user of documentation - the practioner of a craft - at the centre of its
concerns.


Diátaxis
--------

I'm the creator of the `Diátaxis documentation framework <https://diataxis.fr>`_.
Diátaxis is a systematic framework for technical documentation authoring.

    :alt: Documentation architecture: tutorials, how-to guides, reference, explanation

Diátaxis describes an information architecture and approach to content that are informed by an
understanding of the needs of users in their cycle of interaction with a product, or their practice
in a craft.

    Diátaxis - it's like wearing glasses after having lived in a blurred world.

Diátaxis solves a number of difficult problems in documentation, most obviously the problem of
structure. It's popular because it's easy to grasp and use, delivers quick results, and has a good
name.


Documentation practice and strategy
-----------------------------------

Software engineering is a discipline, with standards, methodologies and rigour. The question of
software engineering *practice* is never far from the mind of a professional in the field, and in
an organisation, it's a permanent part of the conversation about work. But *documentation* practice
is notably - strangely - an absent concern.

No serious developer would ever consider "just writing code" to be an adequate approach to creating
software. And yet, entire organisations in effect do exactly that when it comes to documentation.

At the same time, most software organisations recognise that they have serious problems with their
documentation, that stubbornly resist attempts to ameliorate.

Over the last 10 years I've led the documentation efforts of companies (Divio, Canonical) as well
as other organisations and projects, introducing systematic approaches to tackle systematic issues.
The challenges are different in each case, but some themes recur, and some, quite clearly, are
intrinsic to documentation itself.

Documentation extends across its subject matter, and though time. In the former case, the key to
quality is structure - the architecture of the content itself; in the latter, its management of the
documentation lifecycle.

Quality of documentation at scale doesn't simply mean dealing with more of it. Scale adds a new
dimension to the challenge. Good practice must become something that belongs to the organisation
and its way of doing things, that is continually disseminated, reinforced and renewed.

An effective documentation strategy must have adequate answers to the questions of:

* **standards of quality**: a definition of good, that is understood and commands assent
* **culture and discipline**: an organisation-wide attitude of care
* **execution**: ways of working that make it easier to do the right things
* **equipment**: software tools that lessen burdens and cement good practice

You can find an outline of this way of thinking as applied to Canonical in `The future of
documentation at Canonical <https://ubuntu.com/blog/the-future-of-documentation-at-canonical>`_.

The approaches I bring are proven and transformative. They are scalable and maintainable, because
they work with underlying patterns in documentation. They treat documentation as a discipline
within its own right: a domain that functions according to its own particular needs and rules.


Workshops and training
----------------------

I regularly run training workshops, usually to support open-source software projects.

Forthcoming:

* a series of workshops for the Python Software Foundation, to assist Python's adoption of Diátaxis (details
  available soon)

Workshops in recent months include:

* a series of sessions for research software engineers, held as part of fellowship of the
  `Software Sustainability Institute <https://software.ac.uk>`_
* training workshops for contributors to the `Django project <https://djangoproject.com>`_
* training workshops for contributors to `OSM <https://osm.etsi.org>`_, an open-source project
  hosted by the `European Telecommunications Standards Institute <https://www.etsi.org>`_

Enquiries from open-source software projects for coaching or workshops are welcome.

However I am not currently taking on engagements for paid documentation consultancy or coaching -
sorry.


Documentation in open-source software
----------------------------------------

I'm indebted to many software projects that have solved my problems or otherwise improved my life.
I repay that debt where I can by contributing improvements to the documentation of those projects,
or providing training to contributors.

Some examples: `Django <https://djangoproject.com/>`_, `pytest <https://pytest.org/>`_, `django
CMS <https://djang-cms.org/>`_, `BeeWare <https://beeware.org/>`_, `Wagtail
<https://wagtail.org>`_. At the time of writing, I'm working with `Rinohtype
<https://www.mos6581.org/rinohtype/master/>`_.
