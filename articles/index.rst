On being hired
--------------

`Jacob Kaplan-Moss <https://jacobian.org/>`_ has written a series of articles on `hiring
<https://jacobian.org/tags/hiring/>`_ (for software organisations, though a lot of what he has to
say applies much more widely) that he began in November 2018. Put together, they are a substantial
and valuable resource for interviewers and hiring managers.

These articles will also address hiring, written from the perspective of the one hiring, but this
time for the benefit of the one who hopes to be hired.
