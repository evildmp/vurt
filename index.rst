I'm Daniele.

I think it would be better to humanise software than softwarise humans.

I live in Cardiff, UK and Leiden, NL.


Work
----

I'm a Director of Engineering at `Canonical <https://canonical.com/>`_.

I build practice, capacity, skills and methods to help our 40+ engineering teams produce
world-class software documentation by default. It's a long-term transformation project that pays
attention to every aspect of documentation.

Previously, I was at `Divio <https://divio.com/>`_, and before that, at `Cardiff University School
of Medicine <https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/medicine>`_.

..  admonition:: Work with me at Canonical

    We're recruiting for more than 20 fully-remote Technical Author positions, in engineering teams
    across the company. Please take a look at our `Technical Author job description
    <https://canonical.com/careers/3798310/technical-author-ubuntu-and-canonical-products-remote>`_
    for more.


Open-source software
--------------------

I owe a great deal to open-source software. Or more precisely, to open-source communities and the
people in them.

I've made various contributions to software projects of one kind or another, including `Django
<https://djangoproject.com>`_ (core developer since 2013, Vice President of the DSF 2016-2019),
`django CMS <https://django-cms.org>`_ (core developer since 2011), `pytest <https://pytest.org>`_
- and various others in the Python ecosystem.

Since 2014, I've been involved in the organisation of 20 or so open-source software conferences,
in Europe and Africa (and I've spoken and delivered workshops at even more).


Contact me

Please note that I get a considerable quantity of email related to Diátaxis, and while I appreciate
all the interest and do my best to reply, I can't promise to respond to every message.

If you use Twitter, I am `@EvilDMP <https://twitter.com/EvilDMP>`_.
