Daniele at DjangoCon US 2023
============================

I'm on Mastodon: `@EvilDMP@mastodon.online <https://mastodon.online/@EvilDMP>`_. You can also find me on the conference Slack group.

Africa
------

`DjangoCon Africa 2023 <https://2023.djangocon.africa>`_ will take place in Zanzibar, 6-11 November. It's a long way from Durham, NC, but there's still time to get there. If you can't join us but would like to support us, we'd `welcome donations large or small <https://2023.djangocon.africa/donate/>`_.

I'm involved in other African Python events - `PyCon Namibia 2024 in March <https://na.pycon.org/>`_ will be my next. Please ask me if there's anything you'd like to know about Python/Django in Africa.

Documentation
-------------

I'll be at the conference sprints, and if anyone wants to work on or would like some help with documentation (Django, Python, your own OSS project...) let me know.

I'm hiring
----------

I work at Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu, and many other open-source products) and we have dozens of roles open, at all levels of experience, from graduate to director, in several different disciplines (not just software disciplines either).

*All roles are fully-remote, and open to anyone working pretty much anywhere in the world.*

Above all, I would love to come back from DjangoCon US with some **technical authors**, to help create and maintain software documentation. `Read more about being a technical author at Canonical <https://canonical.com/documentation/work-and-careers>`_.

Iâ€™m also involved in hiring for other external-facing disciplines - developer relations (`engineer <https://canonical.com/careers/5143011>`_, `manager <https://canonical.com/careers/4322699>`_) and `community <https://canonical.com/careers/all?search=community>`_.

`All roles at Canonical <https://grnh.se/05c42c4e1us>`_

We use Python all over the place, and Django in a few places.
If you'd like to know more, or would like some advice on how best to apply, please do ask me, either now or after the event.
