Colours
-------

The colours of text, background and other elements of the site are derived from *Breton Woman*
(1920), a woodblock print by the Japanese artist `Kanae Yamamoto
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanae_Yamamoto_(artist)>`_.

Kanae was instrumental in `the 20th-century Sōsaku hanga movement
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sōsaku-hanga>`_ that turned traditional Japanese woodblock
print-making into a creative art in its own right, in which the artist took responsibility for all
the phases of its production.
